The files in this folder were used to analyze and process the digitized books by FAU Library.
The two files in the "results" folder were input and output for an implementation of the kmeans algorithm in Python by kazemjahanbakhsh (you can read more about it here: http://www.kazemjahanbakhsh.com/codes/k-means.html). The implementation was altered slightly to fit the requirements in this project and generate the output file. Also, the extracted images were saved in the "results" folder.
The "source" folder contained the original digitized pages, which can be accessed in the digital collections of FAU Library.
kazemjahanbakhsh holds the rights to this code.

Unfortunately, the work had to be done very quickly, hopefully the documentation is enough.
